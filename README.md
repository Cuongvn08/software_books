# THE MUST-READ SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING BOOKS FOR DEVELOPERS 

I created this repos to summarize the main contents on the books and wrote the respective samples.
Hopefully, it would help to improve your programming skill.

The list belows is a set of essential or must-read software books for any developers.
Inside each separate directory is the book's summarization and its samples which I developed.

1. Effective C++, 3rd edition, Scott Meyers. 
2. Code complete, 2nd edition, Steve McConnel.
